In such circumstances, a Doctor placed reliance upon the Deceased’s own verbal assessment of her own weight and used this information to decide upon the medication dosage. Although I was informed that the Trust is aware of this issue and have considered one method of resolving it [which I understand is not to be implemented], I remain concerned that patients may be prescribed medications at a dosage which is inaccurately determined due to the fact that a patient has incorrectly assessed their own weight, and if patients do not receive the correct dosage future deaths may result.","The inquest also heard evidence that other members of the Deceased’s family had suffered from a similar condition. There were no records to suggest that this relevant information had been obtained by medical staff following her admission, and therefore nor had it been communicated effectively to other staff who may in due course have had involvement in her care.

Thus his death was contributed to, to more than a minimal, trivial and negligible degree, by: (a) industrial disease (b) a natural cause and (c) the unintended consequences of medical treatment (Warfarin use and oxygen therapy).","A history of shortness of breath and collapse and with a medical history of pulmonary fibrosis, ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, calcified pleural plaques and previous myocardial infarction.",-,-,"It was the evidence of a number of clinicians who gave evidence in the course of the inquest that they had not come across a death occasioned by epistaxis in the course of their clinical careers. In those circumstances the cause of the deceased's death may have been unusual. In that regard he received oxygen therapy both in hospital and, following discharge, at home through a nasal cannula and was also prescribed Warfarin on account of his atrial fibrillation. Whilst, for much of the period in question his Internationalised Normalised Ratio fell within the target range of 2.0 — 3.0 he developed epistaxis which, in the context of and in combination with compromised lung and heart function due to pulmonary fibrosis and ischaemic heart disease, caused his death. In the course of preparing statements for the purpose of the inquest 2 practitioners did not identify and/or did not identify the significance of 2 references to nosebleeds (epistaxis) (or the possibility thereof) within the clinical records. Thus the concern arises that (1) the risks of epistaxis causing or contributing to death, particularly in a patient who is receiving oxygen therapy and/or who is taking Warfarin and/or who has underlying conditions which impair lung and/or heart function and (2) the fact that the risk of death may not be avoided merely on account of the maintenance of a patient's Internationalised Normalised Ratio within a target range may not be known generally amongst clinicians such that circumstances creating a risk of other deaths will occur or will continue to exist in the future.",-,-,-,-,-,-,Monitoring failure; Poor awareness of rare ADRs,-,-,

Her breathing became abnormal and irregular and she became unresponsive. Although the overall intention was to transport to John Radcliffe Hospital as a result of the traumatic head injury, the ambulance crew contacted and requested assistance from the nearest hospital, Wycombe Hospital, due to the concern over Mrs Long's compromised airway. Admission was refused with an instruction to attend the nearest Accident & Emergency Unit so, instead, roadside assistance was provided to the crew near Stokenchurch at the M40 junction from an Enhanced Care Response Unit car whilst en route to John Radcliffe Hospital. Due to the severity of the injury Mrs Long had sustained, exacerbated over the day prior to collapse by her warfarin prescription, the refusal of assistance by Wycombe Hospital (part of Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust) did not impact upon the outcome in this case. There was, however, a clear difference of opinion between South Central Ambulance Service and Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust as to the interpretation of the reception policy appropriate to the Cardiac and Stroke Unit at Wycombe. It is understood that informal discussions have been had between both trusts about whether South Central Ambulance Service should or should not be seeking assistance from Wycombe Hospital (where it is the nearest facility) in cases where a compromised airway may lead to cardiac arrest. There is a continuing concern that, in the absence of a clear, formalised understanding, circumstances may arise where either help to stabilise a patient's airway is refused, or a delay occurs as a result of confusion, and a patient dies as a consequence.",-,-,-,-,-,-,Hospital opening times/ availability,-,-,

Paramedics attended and following their assessment, hospital attendance was considered not to be necessary. Mr Godfrey underwent basic checks by staff at the home overnight and no concerns were raised. The following morning he woke around 04.30 and was alert and orientated. Around 07.30 he was noted to be unresponsive. He was admitted to the Queens Hospital where it was found that he had suffered a devastating head injury, from which he died. The head injury is likely to have been caused by the fall on the 23rd July 2013 and Warfarin therapy is likely to have exacerbated the bleed.",He had a past medical history to include atrial fibrillation and DVT’s. As a result of this he was on long term warfarin.,-,-,"Mr Godfrey was an elderly patient who was at risk of falling and who was on long term warfarin. There is an increased risk of bleeding to elderly patients on warfarin who sustain a head injury. Neither the care staff who attended to Mr Godfrey on the evening of the 23rd July 2013 or the paramedic appeared to have been aware of the increased risk of such bleeding in an elderly patient who had sustained a minor head injury. The inquest heard clear evidence from the London Ambulance Service in relation to further training that was to be provided to their staff in relation to this risk. In addition, amendments are to be considered to the LAS guidance, to highlight this risk to all staff.",The staff at the care home accepted the responsibility of Mr Godfrey’s care following the paramedic’s assessment. They agreed to observe Mr Godfrey during the night. The actual checks carried out by the staff were not in accordance with the direction given by the paramedic. The senior care worker confirmed that she did not examine the swelling or check for alertness.,The Deputy Manager who gave evidence at the inquest confirmed that the checks carried out by the staff were not in her view appropriate. She would have expected the pupils to have been checked and checks to ensure that the patient was alert and orientated.,The Deputy Manager who gave evidence confirmed that the checks that were carried out on Mr Godfrey were not appropriately recorded in the clinical records.,The Deputy Manager confirmed that the qualified member of staff who attended when Mr Godfrey sustained his fall should have been aware of the increased risk of bleeding as a result of the long term warfarin. She confirmed that he may not have had access to the medication chart. It is my view that a qualified member of the nursing staff who attends a patient who has suffered a fall should make themselves aware of both the patient’s medical history and medication history.,"The Deputy Manager considered that it would be helpful for the training relating to falls, prevention and management to include the highlighting of the risk of bleeding in elderly patients who are on anti-coagulant medication.

Upon discharge, ten days before her death, a plan was made for district nurses to attend her home daily, to administer tinzaparin injections. However, the referral was never received by the district nursing team, because an obsolete email address that had not been deleted from the computer system was used. I am satisfied that Whittington Health has already taken steps to deal with the cause of the failure of the district nursing team to attend – the obsolete email address.","I write in respect of an ancillary, but nevertheless important matter, that of the instructions given to Ms Stapleton and her family upon discharge. During her six day admission, Ms Stapleton was told explicitly by one of her treating consultants that without medication she could die, and she did understand this. She was then persuaded to remain in hospital for treatment. However, she later decided that perhaps she wanted to leave after all, so on the afternoon of Friday, 2 September 2016, she was detained under section 5(2) of the Mental Health Act. By Monday morning, she was deemed fit for removal of the section, and fit for discharge. It well may have been that her confusion on the Friday had been a consequence more of her low oxygen saturations at that time, than of her schizophrenia. Nevertheless, she was a vulnerable patient. When she was discharged, although the plan of daily district nursing visits was made clear to her, no member of the team had another very explicit conversation with her or with her two sons, about the potential consequence (i.e. death) of the visits and medication administration not taking place. She and her sons were not given the telephone number of the district nursing team and were not told to ring if nurses failed to attend the following day. I understand that patients are now all given a leaflet with the district nursing team telephone number, but I am concerned that there is still a lack of emphasis on this aspect of discharge advice. I heard from one witness that this is a whole team responsibility. Any member of the team – consultant physician, consultant psychiatrist, discharge nurse – could have had this very direct conversation with Ms Stapleton and her family, but nobody did. I appreciate that there may be a reluctance to be so blunt because of a fear of scaring patients, but any reluctance must be overcome in certain situations if patients are to be supported in the best way possible. Indeed, it had already been overcome by one consultant earlier in Ms Stapleton’s admission.",-,-,-,-,-,Poor communication; Poor systems; Discharge process; Failure to warn of the consequences of not taking medication,-,-,

She refused Enoxaparin on a large number of occasions during her time at ROH. On 28th June 2016, Mrs Corfield was detained in hospital under section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1984 as a result of her deteriorating mental health. She was transferred to a mental health unit called Park House run by Manchester Mental Health Trust for possible treatment of her psychiatric condition. At Park House, Mrs Corfield was diagnosed with a severe psychotic depression. Essential treatment in the form of electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) was planned by BLANKED, Consultant Psychiatrist. Unfortunately, Mrs Corfield continued to take very little oral fluids and she became dehydrated. Her condition deteriorated to such an extent that it was no longer safe to administer ECT.",-,"I heard evidence at the Inquest staff at Park House were not aware that Mrs Corfield was receiving an anticoagulant in the form of enoxaparin whilst she was a patient at Royal Oldham Hospital to reduce the risk of her developing a VTE or that she had refused this medication whilst a patient ROH. I received written evidence from BLANKED that the Pennine Acute Trust has in place an Adult Transfer Policy and a Form should be generated which includes details with regards the patient’s medication and most recent observations. However, the evidence I heard from BLANKED, Consultant Psychiatrist at Park House, was that his unit still does not receive a written handover.","Dehydration clearly played a part in Mrs Corfield’s death. I heard evidence at Inquest that Fluid Balance Charts were poorly completed indeed some of them were not completed at all or contained errors with simple arithmetic. At the Inquest, I heard conflicting evidence about the usefulness of fluid balance charts. Witnesses who were employed by Pennine Acute Trust tended to place more reliance on the results of blood tests. However, BLANKED emphasised to me the importance of FBC charts in a patient like Mrs Corfield who had a history of chronic kidney disease because blood tests were an ‘insensitive measure’ of hydration. I received helpful written evidence from BLANKED who is the Divisional Director of Nursing for Medicine at Royal Oldham Hospital, dated 31st January 2019, which, at paragraph 17, shows there are still ongoing problems with the way fluid balance charts are completed some two and a half years after Mrs Corfield’s death.","I heard evidence that although Mrs Corfield was at high risk of developing a VTE, following her admission to Park House on 28th June, prophylactic anticoagulation was not prescribed for her until 30th June when a prescription for clexane (enoxaparin) was issued. Further, although clexane was prescribed, it was never administered to Mrs Corfield.","Further, I also heard evidence that the staff at Park House were not trained to administer intravenous fluids. This meant that Mrs Corfield had to be transferred to a North Manchester Hospital for intravenous fluids when she was in urgent need of specialist psychiatric care and treatment. I formed the view that BLANKED was left extremely frustrated that he was unable to treat Mrs Corfield with intravenous fluids whilst she was a patient at Park House.",-,-,-,Discharge process; Failure to keep accurate medical records; Omission of necessary treatment; Inadequate training,-,-,

He weighed 99.8Kg and the difference between a daily dose of 40mg of Clexane and a twice daily dose of 40mg of Clexane is arbitrarily set at a body weight of 100Kg.

This can and does to confusion. On one page of the notes, the predicted weight was shown as 15stone 10Ibs which was in fact the actual weight and NOT the predicted weight. For the purpose of the accurate delivery of many drugs including anti¬coagulants, accurate weight recording is essential.","There was a shortage of trained nurses in the hospital, and this may have led to at least one of the ""ward moves"".

The guidelines did not state that a patient requires visual observation for a period of time following the removal of the catheter.,"Following the death of the Deceased the Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust has taken action to address the concerns in relation to the Central Venous Catheter Insertion Management and Removal Policy for Short Term Catheters, together with the ongoing training of staff who undertake the removal of catheters and the management of rare complications. A quick reference guide has been issued to staff by the Hospital in relation to the removal of catheters at the Hospital. The guide requires the patient to remain supine for 30 minutes post removal of the catheter with further bed rest for 2 hours post removal and a visual inspection of the dressing every 5 minutes during the period of 1 hour following the removal. However, the guide does not require constant visual observation for a period of time following the removal of the catheter. The evidence at the Inquest was that, if there is haemorrhage following the removal of a catheter, blood loss could amount to 200mls every minute so that in the period of 5 minutes between each 5-minute inspection of the dressing, advised by the guidance, one litre of blood could be lost, which could lead to death. The evidence at the Inquest was that a period of constant visual observation is required for a period of up to one hour following the removal of a catheter to reduce the risk of blood loss rather than simply monitoring by inspecting the dressing every 5 minutes for that period of time.","There are no national guidelines in relation to the removal of central venous catheters, particularly temporary central venous catheters for haemodialysis. The evidence at the Inquest confirmed that the Secretary of State, the Renal Association, the British Renal Society and the Intensive Care Society would be appropriate organisations to consider the issue of a national policy, protocol and guidance relating to the removal of central venous catheters.","The evidence of the Physiotherapist in relation to changing the author times of notes on the central computer note system at the Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust was not believed to be possible by representatives of the Hospital Trust attending the Inquest but the Physiotherapist was adamant, in her evidence, that she changed the times, which was her usual procedure, so that the author time recorded by her represented the time of the action taken by her rather than the time of the note made by her.",-,-,Poor awareness of rare complications of medical procedures; Monitoring failure; Absence of national guidelines; Failure to keep accurate medical records,"I request the Secretary of State for Health, the Renal Association, the British Renal Society and the Intensive Care Society to review the policies and protocols in relation to the removal of central venous catheters and to consider the issue of national guidelines relating to the removal of catheters.

I acknowledge that a considerable amount of work has been done by the Salford NHS Foundation Trust, but I request a further review to cover the above matters of concern; I request the Salford Royal Hospital to review their information technology systems to prevent the changing of author times of notes on the electronic system because the author times can represent an important time in relation to the treatment and care given to a patient and may be relied upon by healthcare professionals who give treatment and care after the time of a note. The review should also consider whether both the time of the author of the report and the time that appropriate action is taken should be included in the note so that healthcare professionals would have to record both times when completing notes to ensure that there is unequivocal clarity as to the time the action was taken and the time the note was authored.",Review national guidelines; Review policy and protocols; Review IT systems,

Accordingly, if a patient require admission to a unit between 23.00 hours and 07.00 hours, the patient must be taken to Salford Royal Hospital. In the case of the deceased, who lived in Chelford, Cheshire, she required admission to a Hyper Acute Stroke unit at 06.28 hours on the 15th April 2019 and the nearest unit to her home address was at Stepping Hill Hospital. However, in view of the time of day and the fact that Stepping Hill would not be open until 07.00 hours, she had to be taken to the Salford Royal Hospital Hyper Acute Stroke unit. The journey to Salford Royal Hospital, rather than Stepping Hill Hospital, involved an additional journey of approximately 18 miles, by ambulance, with an additional travel time of approximately 30 minutes. If she had been admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital Hyper Acute Stroke unit on the 15th April 2019, she could have remained there for continuing treatment, rather than a subsequent transfer from Salford Royal Hospital to Stepping Hill Hospital on the 19th April 2019.","Furthermore, if a patient is in a unit at Fairfield Hospital or Stepping Hill Hospital and requires an urgent medical assessment or medical treatment between 23.00 hours and 07.00 hours, the patient must be referred to the unit at Salford Royal Hospital for advice before considering a transfer to Salford Royal Hospital between those hours.","Evidence given by a Consultant in Stroke Medicine at the Inquest confirmed that patients would benefit from admission to the units at Fairfield Hospital and Stepping Hill Hospital 24 hours a day 7 days a week to enable quicker admission into a unit from all parts of Greater Manchester and to have Doctors available in each unit 24 hours a day, particularly overnight between 23.00 hours and 07.00 hours.

The repeat prescription for Edoxaban was not put on the deceased's repeat prescriptions by the General Practitioner and the deceased did not receive Edoxaban for administration after the 22nd July 2016 and he would not have had a supply of Edoxaban following his self-discharge from the Hospital on the 10th November 2016. The General Practitioner gave evidence that the Surgery had undertaken a ""Significant Event Analysis"" as to how the Edoxaban prescription had been missed and the investigation resulted in the following recommendations within the Surgery to prevent a recurrence: (a) GP to review ""active problems"" on the computer system when any patient comes in, in order to ensure patient is on the appropriate treatment. (b) In respect of discharge letters directing new medication — the letter will be sent on a task to a prescription clerk, who will add the new medication and issue a month's supply.

She was assessed but not given DVT prophylaxis and succumbed to a Pulmonary Embolism at the beginning of the operation on 16 April 2018 to replace the fractured hip.",,,"She was an active lady, relatively fit, and still working as a care assistant prior to her death.","The first concern relates to what are referred to as 'outlying patients'. Mrs Grant went from the emergency department to a neuro-science ward because there were no beds on a trauma ward. It appears that her placement on a ward other than a trauma ward raised issues in respect of her care and, in particular, it meant she was not being cared for by trauma nurses who might ordinarily be expected to pick up the omission concerning VTE prophylaxis. I understand it is relatively common for a trauma patient to be placed on a ward other than a trauma ward. I understand that this may be unavoidable but I am concerned about there being sufficient safeguards in place. I see from the Action Plan that recommendations 1 and 7 refer to this issue. There has been an audit and the trauma co-ordinator is to check VTE prophylaxis has been prescribed to trauma patients outlying on non-trauma wards. I seek reassurance that the audit of care for such patients confirms that the same standard of care is delivered regardless of location. I also seek information and reassurance about the practical steps taken by the trauma co-ordinator to check VTE prophylaxis. There were a number of system checks which failed in this case and it is therefore important that system checks are effective.","The second concern relates to ignoring the VTE prophylaxis alerts on EPR. I note from the RCA Report that the warning was visible on exiting the record by all staff. explained however that often the warning would not be seen because sometimes a doctor does not actually exit the record but keeps it open (albeit secure). It is surprising that from the time of transfer to the neuro-science ward from ED until the time when the patient was seen by the Consultant Anaesthetist on the morning of surgery on 16 April that the EPR was accessed 27 times by staff members and yet none of the staff interviewed recalled seeing the alert. A system designed with fail-safes in the form of alerts is obviously not effective if the alerts are not seen or routinely ignored. Recommendation 8 on the Action Plan refers to this issue and I see that an email has been sent out to the EPR Lead and that a new version of EPR will prevent staff being able to exit the EPR record until VTE alerts have been dealt with. As mentioned, it seems though that doctors do not always exit the record and, as I understand it, the alert will not pop up unless the record is being exited. It would be appreciated if you could provide some clarification on this and also address the wider issue of alerts not being acted upon.",-,-,-,-,-,Failure to triage patients appropriately; Poor systems; Omission of necessary treatment,-,-,

She gave evidence that when Mr Thornton was admitted from Derriford, he arrived without an E-discharge, a copy of his prescription chart or his prescribed medication. As he was admitted during a Sunday evening where there was no medical cover in the hospital, this created very real difficulties. The out of hours service had to be contacted for a doctor to attend. In the event, that Doctor refused to prescribe blood thinning medication and Mr Thornton did not receive any for nearly 24 hours notwithstanding his known history of DVTs. told me that this ""happens frequently.""","I also heard from Doctor Sant. He works in Liskeard hospital on Mondays and Fridays. On Mondays, he deals with patients who have had been admitted from Derriford over the course of the weekend.

This is important as the amount of anti-coagulant drugs to be given according to the SGH thromboprophylaxis protocol is calculated on weight.","As stated above, on 15 March when the clinical decision was made to withhold the morning dose of Tpx medication it could not be ascertained who made the decision. This was a significant clinical decision and it is a basic requirement that all clinical decisions are recorded in order to capture capturing who made the decision and why.","In respect of both of these concerns, during the investigation I learned through the Root Cause Analysis that a Trauma & Orthopaedic Morbidity & Mortality meeting had been held. In addition, I was told during the inquest that a nonogram was now in use to improve weight estimation for those patients where it was not possible to obtain actual weight and that training was underway in relation to its use for elderly patients. I also heard that some new beds with built in weighing scales were to be purchased within 2 months subject to cost and commissioning. Whilst a valuable tool, a single T&O M&M meeting is only effective for those doctors and nursing staff who attend. I was not given any other detail as to how the valuable lessons to be learned from this case were to be spread to clinical staff across the T&O department or the whole Trust as weight estimation can be equally important in many other medical specialisms.

I am concerned about the training schedule, particularly for those with little or no background medical knowledge. Whilst reliant on algorithms, advisors must be able to recognise potentially fatal illnesses and deteriorating conditions as thousands of patients rely on this service for medical help. Clinical advisors on duty were not consulted in this complex case. The senior manager for Quality and Clinical Governance at KMSS 111 expressed concern at the algorithm used in the case of Mrs Ellis .The clinical algorithm called NHS Pathways is owned by the Department of Health and was felt to be imprecise but despite representations to the Department of Health by KMSS 111 for changes and improvement there has been no positive communication since February.",A disposition from 111 was made to IC24 for a telephone consultation by an on call clinician. This was received and logged and a call was made within one hour. There was no response by the carer and a note was made to call back within 5 minutes. Apparently the case was closed before this could occur; no explanation could be given as to why this happened. Training for clinical staff in the use of the computer system used by IC24 is essential but did not appear well organised and should be rectified.,The results of investigations by both KMSS and IC24 should result in a joint RCA.
